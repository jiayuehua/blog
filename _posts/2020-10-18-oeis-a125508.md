Besides Scott Kim's "Celebration of Mind" talk discussed in [my previous post](/blog/2020/10/18/scott-kim-gardner-ambigrams/),
I also today attended Gordon Hamilton's talk on
"Mini Mathematical Universes." (Hamilton is also known as the designer of the board game
[_Santorini_](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/194655/santorini) (2016).) This was essentially
an excuse to talk about a numerical process that Hamilton calls "Integral Fission."

Define $$\mathrm{fission(N)}$$ for an integer $$N\ge 2$$ as follows:

* If $$N$$ is prime, then the answer is $$N$$ itself.
* Otherwise, choose $$L\le R$$ such that $$L\cdot R=N$$ and
    the difference $$R-L$$ is minimized; the answer is $$(\mathrm{fission}(L),\mathrm{fission}(R))$$.

For example, $$\mathrm{fission}(42) = ((2,3),7)$$;
$$\mathrm{fission}(43) = 43$$;
$$\mathrm{fission}(44) = ((2,2),11)$$;
$$\mathrm{fission}(45) = (5,(3,3))$$;
$$\mathrm{fission}(46) = (2,23)$$;
and $$\mathrm{fission}(48) = ((2,3),(2,(2,2)))$$.

Notice that $$\mathrm{fission}(42)$$ and $$\mathrm{fission}(44)$$ have the same "shape":
if we ignore the numbers and just look at the parentheses, they're both of the form $$((x,x),x)$$.

Hamilton considers the increasing sequence of integers whose fissions yield _novel shapes_ —
that is, the sequence consists of only those positive integers whose fission yields a shape
not yielded by any smaller integer.

* $$\mathrm{fission}(2)$$ is $$x$$
* $$\mathrm{fission}(4)$$ is $$(x,x)$$
* $$\mathrm{fission}(8)$$ is $$(x,(x,x))$$
* $$\mathrm{fission}(16)$$ is $$((x,x),(x,x))$$
* $$\mathrm{fission}(20)$$ is $$((x,x),x)$$
* $$\mathrm{fission}(32)$$ is $$((x,x),(x,(x,x)))$$
* $$\mathrm{fission}(40)$$ is $$(x,(x,(x,x)))$$

This sequence (2, 4, 8, 16, 20, 32, 40...) is [OEIS sequence A125508](https://oeis.org/A125508):

    2 4 8 16 20 32 40 64 72 88 128 160 176 200 220 256
    272 288 320 336 360 400 420 460 480 512 540 544 640
    704 864 880 920 1024 1056 1152 1184 1200 1280 1344
    1440 1600 1640 1680 1800 1840 1920 2048 ...


## Does every prime eventually appear in a leaf?

The sequence of _trees_ involved in OEIS A125508 goes like this:

$$
    2; (2,2); (2,(2,2)); ((2,2),(2,2)); ((2,2),5); ((2,2),(2,(2,2))); \ldots
$$

Two terms further on, we spot our first factor of 3. Eleven terms later, we spot our first 7.
So naturally, someone in the webinar asked: "Does _every_ prime number appear as a factor
somewhere in this sequence?"

I have no idea how you'd prove such a conjecture.
So I wrote a little C++ program ([source](/blog/code/2020-10-18-integral-fission.cpp)) to play around with "Integral Fission."

* Term 7958, which is the integer 126247680, is the first term divisible by 281;
    by that point we've seen every other prime up to 347 inclusive.

* Term 22920, which is the integer 1368482048, is the first term divisible by 349;
    by that point we've seen every other prime up to 653 inclusive.


## Does the sequence contain any odd number?

I conjecture that every term in OEIS A125508 is divisible by two.

Pseudo-proof: In order to have an odd term, _all_ of the leaves in its decomposition would have
to be odd; which means they'd all have to be greater than 2; which means that if you took that
same tree and replaced the leftmost leaf with a 2, you'd end up with a smaller integer
producing that same shape; contradiction, Q.E.D.

But that's not a real proof! — because blindly substituting 2 into a leaf won't always
produce a valid fission at all.
Consider $$\mathrm{fission}(357) = (17,(3,7))$$.

* If you replace the 17 with a 2, you get $$(2,(3,7))\ne ((2,3),7)$$.
* If you replace the 3 with a 2, you get $$(17,(2,7))\ne ((2,7),17)$$;
* If you replace the 7 with a 2, you get $$(17,(2,3))\ne ((2,3),17)$$.

Supposing for the sake of argument that every term is divisible by two,
is there a point after which every subsequent term is divisible by four?

Out of the first 20000 terms of OEIS A125508, here are the only terms
indivisible by four. (For example, the 8432nd term is the integer 148527918.)

    821 642978 (((3,(3,3)),(3,(3,3))),((3,7),((2,3),7)))
    1004 1010394 (((3,(3,3)),(3,11)),((3,(3,3)),((2,3),7)))
    1766 3521070 (((3,(3,3)),(3,23)),(((2,3),7),(5,(3,3))))
    1890 4133430 ((((2,3),7),(5,(3,3))),((3,(3,3)),((3,3),(3,3))))
    2639 9093546 (((3,11),((3,3),(3,3))),(((2,3),(3,3)),(7,(3,3))))
    8432 148527918 ((((3,3),(3,3)),(7,(3,7))),(((3,3),11),((3,3),(2,7))))
    15975 682015950 ((((3,3),(3,5)),((3,3),(3,7))),(((3,3),(3,(2,3))),(11,(3,5))))
    18083 876877650 ((((3,3),(3,(2,3))),(11,(3,5))),(((3,3),(3,5)),((3,3),(3,(3,3)))))

However, among terms 20000 to 30000, _seventeen_ of them are indivisible by 4,
suggesting that the frequency of terms indivisible by 4 may be increasing rather than
decreasing. I can imagine how this might be so, since there's an increasing number
of possible "non-2" prime factors to choose from.

    29576 2111001750 (((11,(3,(2,3))),((3,5),(3,5))),((13,(3,5)),((3,3),(3,(3,3)))))

Is this evidence that if we go high enough we might eventually find a term
indivisible by 2?


## How fast does the sequence grow?

Anecdotally, it seems to grow in fits and starts. For example,
there are only 138 terms between 150,000 and 160,000; but there
are 254 terms between 170,000 and 180,000.

If [the count of $$n$$'s prime factors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_omega_function)
grows as $$\log \log n$$, does that mean that we should expect to see
$$k$$-leaf trees appearing around $$e^{e^k}$$? But then
[the number of $$k$$-leaf trees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catalan_number)
itself grows as $$4^n$$... so should we expect the terms of the sequence to grow
roughly exponentially?


## What if we change the definition of isomorphism?

Watching Hamilton's YouTube video on "Integral Fission," I was struck by the
fiddliness of having to put the smaller factor on the left every time. What if
we eliminate the distinction between the left and right subtrees of a decomposition,
so that the tree $$((2,2),5)$$ is considered to have the same "shape" as
$$(2,(2,2))$$?

In that case, we boringly get a subsequence of OEIS A125508:

    2 4 8 16 32 40 64 128 160 176 256
    512 544 640 704 880 920 1024 1200
    1280 1440 1600 2048 2176 2368 2560
    2816 3456 4096 8192 8576 8704 ...


## What if we change the source being filtered?

Hamilton's sequence is basically taking the sequence $$2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8\ldots$$
and passing it through this "novelty filter." What if we took a different sequence
to filter, instead? For example, what if we took only the integers divisible by three?

    3 6 12 24 42 48 72 84 96 156 192 240
    288 300 312 336 360 384 420 480 540
    672 696 768 864 966 1056 1152 1176 ...

Or what if we took only the integers divisible by ten?

    10 20 30 40 60 80 120 160 200 220 320
    360 400 420 460 480 540 600 640 720
    800 810 880 920 930 960 1080 1120 ...

Or only the Fibonacci numbers?

    2 8 21 144 610 2584 6765 46368 832040
    2178309 14930352 102334155 ...

No conclusions here; I'm just playing around with numbers in a very non-mathematician
kind of way. If you've got thoughts on the evenness conjecture above, I'd like to
hear from you!

The first 30000-ish terms of OEIS A125508 are [here](/blog/code/2020-10-18-integral-fission.txt).
