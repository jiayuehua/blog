Ira Levin's 1967 novel _Rosemary's Baby_ features the fictional book _All Of Them Witches_,
by J.R. Hanslet. Roman Polanski's 1968 film adaptation shows the book on-screen — a prop
with surprisingly well-curated dummy text. I like freeze-framing text from movies,
so, here's my transcription and close reading of _All Of Them Witches_.

Fair warning: if you didn't arrive here by freeze-framing _Rosemary's Baby_ and
googling a piece of text from it, this post may not hold much for you.

If you recognize the provenance of any of the "unknown source" snippets below,
please tell me about it and I'll update the post!

The name "J.R. Hanslet" is apparently a reference to Chief Inspector Hanslet, from a series
of detective novels by [John Rhode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cecil_Street),
beloved by Ira Levin. (Source: [TVTropes](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/RosemarysBaby).)

The book is inscribed (1:27:15) with the
name "Edward Hutchins" and "Torquay, 1934."
(Thanks, [novel](https://archive.org/details/LevinIraRosemary1RosemarysBaby2010Norton/page/n135)
and [original screenplay](http://www.sellingyourscreenplay.com/wp-content/uploads/screenplay/scripts/Rosemarys-Baby.pdf),
for deciphering the word "[Torquay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torquay)"!
TVTropes says that William Castle once said that this was Roman Polanski's first book-to-film
adaptation, and Polanski didn't know he was allowed to change things.)

Rosemary flips quickly through most of the pages. The only recto page
that I can actually read (1:27:19) is a bit of an Easter egg: it has a
bit on "the universally held belief in the power of fresh blood"
stuck in the middle of a page from an unknown source. The same phrase shows up
in the [novel](https://archive.org/details/LevinIraRosemary1RosemarysBaby2010Norton/page/n136)
and [screenplay](http://www.sellingyourscreenplay.com/wp-content/uploads/screenplay/scripts/Rosemarys-Baby.pdf),
suggesting that this page might have been meant for use in a shot
that was cut from the final film.

    Ages no houses had chimneys, so witches can only have used a
    hole in the roof — a slightly more possible means of exit. Now if
    witches and fairies derive their common characteristics from a
    prehistoric race who lived in caves and hillsides, this could have
    had a basis of truth. Fairy dwellings are described as being below
    ground and of the old type, with a communal hall and central
    hearth. The only exist from such places o the upper air would
    have been upwards: the inmates literally 'went out through the
    roof' and it was probably reports of this that were later misunder-
    stood and construed as 'flying'.

    New born babies were used whenever possible in their rituals
    because of the Universally held belief in the power of fresh
    blood. The baby would be dressed in black and would be sur-
    rounded by candles, which needless to say were also black.

    Another possible explanation of witches' flights is that they were
    dreaming, or were in a state of self-hypnosis. To dream of flying
    is very common among ... of popular psy-
    chology will ... The 'dream' theory has in fact been ad-
    vanced, by those who believe that witches were victims of sexual
    hysteria, as an explanation for the whole night, ... and all;
    but there is too much ... the sub-

A fleetingly visible verso page (1:27:20) quotes from Reginald Scot's
[_Discoverie of Witchcraft_](https://archive.org/details/discoverieofwitc00scot/page/472) (1584),
but I don't know the source of the text that's doing the quoting.
The word "Dôme" here is part of a reference to the
[temple of Mercury on the summit of the Puy de Dôme](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temple_de_Mercure_(puy_de_Dôme)).

    There were, however, many possible places. Reginald Scot
    (1584):
    "As for the places of Magical Circles, they are

    or amongst ruins of Castles, Abbeys, Monasteries, &c., or upon
    the Seashore when the Moon shines clear, or else in some
    Parlor hung with black and the floor covered with the same, with
    doors and windows closely shut, and waxen candles lighted."

Finally Rosemary lights on the page for [Thomas Colley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Colley)
(1:27:21). The illustration on the verso page is actually an engraving of astrologer
[William Lilly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Lilly)
([William Marshall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Marshall_(illustrator)), 1647;
[National Portrait Gallery](https://www.npg.org.uk/collections/search/portrait/mw136179/William-Lilly)).
The text on the recto page is from three different sources, neither of which I can identify.
You'd think the phrase "wickerwork dummy of the Pope" should be relatively unique,
but in fact it's been cribbed back and forth by a whole host of writers at this point.

    CHAPTER SIX
    THOMAS COLLEY

    Inevitably, since the god of the old religion becomes the devil
    of the new, the tables were turned. Puss's public image changed
    from white to black, for the very qualities and associations which
    had endeared her to the ancient world made her suspect in the
    colder one of Christianity. Amorality became _im_morality, and the
    unbiddable, thieving side to the cat's nature was emphasized.
    Isis, via the person of Diana into whom she merged, degenerated
    from moon-goddess into Maid of the Witches. The cat went with
    her. Ceremonial sacrifices of god-cats were replaced by massacres
    of cats who were considered to be devils. The popular medieval
    practice of burning baskets of cats to death on Good Friday
    or whipping them on Shrove Tuesday were examples of this. Puss
    had apparently become the scapegoat of Christianity. It was said
    that every Good Friday black cats tended to disappear, hiding in
    shame — though it would seem far more likely in the circumstances
    that they hid on that day to save their skins. At times the symbolic
    nature of this cat-persecution was hideously petty. At the corona-
    tion of Elizabeth I of England a wickerwork dummy of the Pope
    faith in a matter of a century or two. For many hundred years,
    through the era of the Danish invasions, Christianity for the masses
    remained largely a matter of what was expedient for the rulers. A
    and magic murder rather than for practising any particular rituals.
    It is important to bear in mind that the word 'witch' denotes
    different things at different eras. 'Witchcraft' is whatever the
    standard, established cult is _not_. Witches in the ancient world

Observe that as Rosemary flips through the book from back to front,
Chapter Seven (1:27:22) actually comes _earlier_ in the book than
Chapter Six. "Prudence Duvernoy" is actually the name of a minor character
from Alexandre Dumas _fils'_ 1848 novel [_La Dame aux Camélias_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Dame_aux_Camélias);
and the name does _not_ appear in Ira Levin's novel.
I have no idea who's in the photograph on the verso page.
The caption under it seems
to say "[Mary Butters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carnmoney#Mary_Butters),"
but that's probably not right, as the famous Mary Butters pre-dated
photography. ([FilmDope](http://filmdope.com/forums/101050-books-films-3.html)
has a screencap including the caption.) The text's two sources are a mystery to me.

    CHAPTER SEVEN
    PRUDENCE DUVERNOY

    The popular prejudice is in favour of them eating dead babies,
    but the reality seems to have been rather more complex. The
    weekly _ezbat_ was mainly a business meeting to discuss any pro-
    jects afoot, there would be some sort of meal at it but not much
    in the way of religious ceremony. It was usually held at night
    for the reasons mentioned in the last chapter (convenience) but
    it could be held by day and sometimes was. In spite of the
    popular idea to the contrary, witches' activities were not inevitably
    linked with darkness — after all, the original fertility rites could
    hardly have been, and the few vestiges of them that have come
    down to us in _respectable_ guise as opposed to witchcraft guise
    (Morris dances, the maypole) are very much sunlit-afternoon
    affairs.
    The Sabat, however, was always held at night in the centuries
    with which we are dealing. The general pattern of a full-scale
    Sabat seems to have been as follows:
    The worshippers began by paying homage to the god/Devil,
    reports of magic worked since the previous Sabat, demands for
    advice, etc. Then came new admissions into the society. The
    candidates had to join of their _own free will_ (a point that is often
    monotheistic, ascetic and (most important) moral, it was not the
    complete innovation one might suppose. I have said that no
    religion is ever entirely new. Christian dogma contained (and con-
    tains) a number of ideas which are older than itself and which
    seem to form a kind of psychological staple in most religions. The

1:27:27: Rosemary pauses again at a custom-written paragraph about
"Devil's Pepper" (i.e., tannis root) sandwiched between snippets of text
reused from the Colley and Duvernoy pages.

    It is important to bear in mind that the word 'witch' denotes
    different things at different eras. 'Witchcraft' is whatever the
    standard, established cult is _not_. Witches in the ancient world
    would hardly be persecuted for rites concerning a Horned ...
    since such fertility rites were then a part of established religion.
    And even after the coming of Christianity, some of the old rites
    continued to be tolerated (see previous chapter). It was a number
    of centuries before those who practised ancient rituals — or per-
    haps idiosyncratic ones — began to be regarded with real horror
    or fear.

    In their rituals they often use the fungus called Devil's
    Pepper. This is a spongy matter derived from swampy regions
    having a strong pungent odor. Devil's Pepper is considered to
    have special powers. It has been used in rituals and worn
    on charms.

    Although Christianity was a considerable new departure, being
    monotheistic, ascetic and (most important) moral, it was not the
    complete innovation one might suppose. I have said that no
    religion is ever entirely new. Christian dogma contained (and con-
    tains) a number of ideas which are older than itself and which
    seem to form a kind of mythological staple in most religions. The

The "Adrian Marcato" page appears in its entirety (1:27:40).
It seems to contain snippets from three sources, in addition to
the first two custom-written paragraphs.

    CHAPTER FOUR
    ADRIAN MARCATO

    Born in Glasgow in 1846, he was soon after brought to New
    York. He resided for several years in the United States but
    spent a great deal of his time on the Continent and in travel.
    He was educated at Oxford and during the course of his stud-
    ies he became interested in Black Magic. Soon he left England
    and devoted himself completely to Satanism.

    The peak of his popularity was in 1896 when he claimed to
    have called forth Satan and was attacked by a mob outside
    the Bramford. He had to leave New York soon after. Similar
    happenings occurred in Stockholm in 1898 and in Paris in
    1899.

    We know who he was in mythical terms. He was a decadent
    Janus and thus both evil and good. He was also, in part, Dis the
    Greek god of the Underworld, Loki the wicked Norse god, the
    Jewish Satan, the Eastern djinn, and even the Indian Siva the
    Destroyer. He was also the hornèd Osiris, his descendant Pan, and
    all the other classical satyrs and local European animal gods. It
    was from these last that he inherited the distinctive features
    usually ascribed to him: he was black, or at any rate dark-skinned,
    he had horns, a hairy or leathery skin, cloven hoofs, long ears, a
    cat into the sea to raise a storm is the best example of this). The
    true familiar, that was regarded by the Church, and sometimes
    by the witch as well, as an imp or "devil" with a small "d", was
    always small, a domestic pet. Sometimes these seem to have been
    Jupiter. The Isis and Osiris cults "went underground" and filtered
    both southwards into Africa and northwards into Europe. This

She turns to the next page (1:28:01).
The full page is visible, except for the dog-eared upper right corner —
and we know what it says under the dog-ear because finally we _do_
have the original source for this page! This page comes from
[_A Handbook on Witches_](https://books.google.com/books?id=uu99AAAAMAAJ&q=riven)
(Gillian Tindall, 1965).
Tindall is describing the 1662 trial of Scottish witch
[Isobel Gowdie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isobel_Gowdie).
(The giveaway was the phrase "riven upon iron harrows, and worse.")
Tindall describes Gowdie as having been hanged and cremated;
in fact there is no historical record of her execution.

    for I have done so many evil deeds, especially killing of men... I
    deserve to be riven upon iron harrows, and worse if it could be
    devised.' In fact she probably knew this would not happen, she
    was simply hanged at the West Point of Elgin, and her body was
    afterwards burnt and the ashes scattered. It is possible that she
    _wanted_ to die, seeing herself making a kind of ultimate sacrifice
    to the Devil, her master? Psychologically she is a most interesting
    puzzle. It does not seem likely that she was completely mad and
    imagined the whole thing. Her evidence, all of which fit in with
    that given in other cases, was delivered clearly and soberly. She
    was examined on several different occasions and never once con-
    tradicted herself, as she surely would have if the wealth of factual,
    and circumstantial testimony had been totally delusional. Nor does
    it seem likely that she was consciously story-telling. The typical
    pseudo-confession of a hysteric 'snowballs', gaining more exotic
    embellishments at each recital, hers did not. Moreover, though
    much of what she said may seem fantastic, very little of it is
    actually implausible. She could hardly have assumed cat and hare
    shape except in a dream, but the 'fairy-land' she visited sounds
    quite earthy enough to have been a secret encampment of hill-folk
    or outlaws. (Fairies and bandits were sometimes identified, as wit-
    ness the folk-character Robin Hood, who is mentioned in Chapter
    Seven.) The prosaic details she gave of coven organization and
    membership are entirely convincing.
    It is clear, however, that at no time did she have any doubt that
    the cult she followed was evil — unlike, probably, the less intelligent,
    peasant witches of earlier times. This suggests that she was a
    psychopathic personality — that is, one in full possession of her
    wits in the legal sense, but quite undeveloped emotionally, in
    whom the definitions 'good' and 'bad' have only a shadowy,
    theoretical meaning rather than a personally perceived one. If this
    was her case, it may be assumed that beneath her apparently cool
    and rational exterior she hid an insatiable craving for power and
    attention — even punishing attention, notoriety being much pre-
